/**
 * A view that is responsible for displaying and handling an `NSView` within the
 * normal Velvet view hierarchy.
 *
 * @warning *Important:* `VELNSView` is powerful, but very fragile, and many of
 * its interactions with AppKit rely upon assumptions, magic, or unspecified
 * behavior. To that end, there are several restrictions on what you can do with
 * `VELNSView`:
 *
 * - *A `VELNSView` must always appear on top of Velvet views.* A `VELNSView`
 * should always appear at the end of a subview list. You should not attempt to
 * add Velvet subviews directly to a `VELNSView`. Instead, if you need Velvet
 * views to appear on top, nest an <NSVelvetView> within the `NSView` and start
 * a new Velvet hierarchy.
 *
 * - *You must not modify the geometry of the hosted `NSView`.* If you need to
 * rearrange or resize the `NSView`, modify the `VELNSView` and it will perform
 * the necessary updates.
 *
 * - *You must not touch the layer of the hosted `NSView`.* If you wish to
 * perform animations or apply other Core Animation effects, use the layer of
 * the `VELNSView`. Note that not all Core Animation features may be available.
 *
 * - *You should not subclass `VELNSView`.* If you need additional features,
 * create a new view class which contains a `VELNSView` instead.
