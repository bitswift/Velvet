 * A controller responsible for managing the lifecycle of a <VELView> and
 * presenting it on screen.
 *
 * A view controller is the next responder for its view. A view controller's
 * next responder is set as follows:
 *
 *  1. If the <view> has a <[VELView superview]>, the superview is the next
 *  responder.
 *  2. If the <view> has a <[VELView hostView]>, the host view is the next
 *  responder.
 *  3. Otherwise, there is no next responder.
 *
 * Upon deallocation, a `VELViewController` instance automatically removes undo
 * actions targeting itself from any `-[NSResponder undoManager]`.
