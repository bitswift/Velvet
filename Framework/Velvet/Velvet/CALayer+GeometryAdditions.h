 * along the way (including the receiver, `layer`, and the common ancestor) have
 * `masksToBounds` set to `YES`, the rectangle takes into account their clipping
 * paths, such that the final result represents a rectangle that would actually
 * be visible on screen.

 * @param layer The layer whose coordinate system `rect` should be represented
 * in.
